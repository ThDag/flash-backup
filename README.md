# Flash-backup
A flash drive that is dedicated for all your backups such as; anyfile, Bitwarden
passwords, obsidian vault, anything else. And plans to integrate more services.


# The Idea
the intention is to have a usb-drive that can be easy backup anything you want by
plugging in and running a script.  This is not intended as primary way of backing
up necceary stuff but instead secondary backup. That gives you the relief of knowing
even if everything goes down you have you files in a physical drive somewhere save.

objective it to make the regular task of "plug n backup" as seamless and easy as
possible.  This way you can have the habit of backing up your most important data
every day/week/month.
